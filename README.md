# Simple Questionnaire Form

This is a simple questionnaire form application built with React, TypeScript, and React Hook Form. It allows users to answer a series of questions and view the completed form.

## Features

- User can answer given questions in the form.
- User can view the completed form with all the answered questions.
- Form validation is implemented using React Hook Form (basic validation showcase).

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Adds static typing to JavaScript for better safety and developer experience.
- **React Hook Form**: Simplifies form management with React.
- **Styled Components**: Preprocessor for CSS to create better structured and styled components.
- **Redux**: State management library for managing the application state.
- **React Redux**: Official React bindings for Redux.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Toolset for efficient Redux development.
- **Redux Context**: Context API for managing application state without passing props down the component tree.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd questionnaire-form`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start` or `yarn start`
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application running.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `src/`
  - `components/`: Contains reusable UI components used in the application.
  - `app/`: Contains the Redux store setup.
  - `features/`: Contains the state slice for managing the application state.
  - `tools/`: Contains utility functions used throughout the application.
  - `App.tsx`: Entry point of the application.
  - `index.tsx`: Renders the root component and mounts the application.

## State Management

The application uses Redux for state management to centralize the application state and avoid prop drilling. The state slice manages all the information of the application, including the user's answers to the questions. Redux Context API is used to provide the Redux store to the components.

## Improvements

Here are some improvements that can be implemented for a production-ready application:

- **Unit tests**: Implement thorough unit tests using testing frameworks like Jest and React Testing Library to ensure the reliability of the components and features.
- **Form validation**: Implement more comprehensive form validation logic to enforce required fields, validate input formats, and handle error messages.
- **Enhanced styling**: Polish and refine the styles using styled components or other CSS frameworks to create an aesthetically pleasing user interface.
- **Error handling**: Implement error handling for network requests, form submission failures, and other potential errors to provide a better user experience.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the application meets accessibility standards by including proper semantic structure, ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigation support.
- **Deployment**: Configure deployment scripts and deploy the application to a hosting service to make it accessible online.
